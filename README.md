BDInfo - Display Blu-ray disc media info
========================================

This program is written in C# and targets .NET 2.0.  It is able to parse and display the video metadata on Blu-ray discs.

It seems that the original developer's website has gone offline:

This repository hosts the latest source code from there.  Additional features or bug fixes may (or may not) be authored here.



Building using Mono on Linux
----------------------------

Mono version 3.2.8 (which is shipped at least as of Ubuntu 15.04) is not new enough.  You'll need to get an updated version:

Then you can build the project as follows:

> cd BDInfo && xbuild /p:Configuration=Release BDInfo.csproj
